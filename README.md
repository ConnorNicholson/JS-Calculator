# JS-Calculator

This project is a calculator function made using Javascript. Currently the calculator itself is not styled.
When the application starts, the user will be asked via alerts to choose 2 numbers and a mathematical operator.
Depending on the type of input, the function will then proceed to execute the calculation.
